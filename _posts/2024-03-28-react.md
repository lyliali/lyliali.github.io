**Stateless functional component**
* Acts like pure function.
* Accepts props and returns JSX.

```
const myComponent = (props) => { ... }
```

**Stateless component**
* Extends React component
* No internal state

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component { ... }
```

Best practices:
* Minimize internal state, and create stateless functional components wherever possible.
* Contain state management to a specific area of your app.

**State**: Any data relevant to the app that can change over time.
* Declared in the _constructor_ of React components.

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            key: val,
            key: val,
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
* Allows UI to respond to changing data.
* State is local to the scope of the component it's declared in.
* Always use `this.setState()` to modify state.
```
{/* Pass in an object literal */}
this.setState({ ... });
```
or
```
{/* Pass in a function */}
this.setState((event) => ({
    ...
}));
```
* State flows in one direction (unidirectional data flow)
* Stateful parent --> child components
* Separate state logic from UI logic
