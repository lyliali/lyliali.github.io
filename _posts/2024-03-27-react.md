# React

* Back after a brief spiral into self doubt and anxiety.
* My new motivation is to team up with my UX designer friend and create the front-end for some of her portfolio mockups on Figma.
* My first step is learning React on FreeCodeCamp. Why?
* Proficiency with React is a marketable skill, and I'm pretty sure I can use it to build her designs.

# Definitions

* **JSX**: Syntax that allows you to nest HTML in JavaScript. All tags must be closed. Some words are different, `class` becomes `className`.
* **React Component**: Can be rendered with ES6 class syntax or functional syntax.
* **Document Object Model (DOM)**: Describes structure of how webpage elements are broken into smaller parts (nodes) and rendered.
* The actual motivation behind choosing between the ES6 class syntax and functional syntax remain to be seen.
* I'm not sure what is meant by "stateless functional component".

# ES6 class syntax React component boilerplate

```
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
    render() {
        return (
            {/* This is JSX */}
            <div>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

# Functional syntax React component boilerplate

```
const MyComponent = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        </div>
    );
}
```

# How to pass in a prop to a React component

```
<MyComponent name='Lylia' />
```

In this example, name is a property. The value of name is 'Lylia'. MyComponent is a React component. The name property can be accessed through `props`: `props.name`.

JavaScript libraries can be used to assign values to properties using curly braces {}.
