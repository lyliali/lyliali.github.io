# foraying into mongoDB

* found a simple walkthrough on [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/mongodb/index.php)
* first impressions, this is all quite similar to the backend of FAST at intersystems which used intersystems' IRIS document database.
* the more i learn about technology, the more i understand the unique selling points of IRIS.
* anyway, reading through this tutorial elucidated the difference between mongosh syntax and the VScode playground i generated through atlas.
* the VScode playground provides autocomplete for mongosh API.
* the mongosh API is a javascript API. ([reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.4/reference/mongo-shell/))
* my new goal is to make a node.js playground that uses all of the operations covered in this w3 tutorial.

# setting up my playground

* following [this tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/playgrounds/) to set up a playground in VSCode
* made file stubs for all of the queries that i want to use
* loaded my database with sample data
* i'm off to the races!

# doing the basics

* finish up basic mongodb queries following [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/mongodb/index.php) and [mongo shell quick reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.4/reference/mongo-shell/)
* pushed to my new [github repo](https://github.com/lyliali/mongodb-playground) for this playground
* hiring gods, plz notice me. sending thoughts and prayers to my future self.
