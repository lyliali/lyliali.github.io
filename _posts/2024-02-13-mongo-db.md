# foraying into mongoDB

* found a simple walkthrough on [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/mongodb/index.php)
* first impressions, this is all quite similar to the backend of FAST at intersystems which used intersystems' IRIS document database.
* the more i learn about technology, the more i understand the unique selling points of IRIS.
* anyway, reading through this tutorial elucidated the difference between mongosh syntax and the VScode playground i generated through atlas.
* the VScode playground uses the node.js mongodb driver to interact with the database. of course!
* my new goal is to make a little node.js playground that uses all of the operations covered in this w3 tutorial.
