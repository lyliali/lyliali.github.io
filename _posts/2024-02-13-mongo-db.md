# foraying into mongoDB

* Found a simple walkthrough on [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/mongodb/index.php)
* First impressions, this is all quite similar to the backend of FAST at intersystems which used InterSystems' IRIS document database.
* The more I learn about technology, the more I understand the unique selling points of IRIS.
* I tried connecting to my sample database through my terminal and VSCode.
* The VSCode playground I generated through Atlas provides autocomplete for mongosh API.
* The mongosh API is a JavaScript API. ([reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.4/reference/mongo-shell/))
* My new goal is to make a [VSCode playground](https://github.com/lyliali/mongodb-playground) that uses all of the operations covered in this W3 tutorial.

# setting up my playground

* Followed [this tutorial](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-vscode/playgrounds/) to set up a playground in VSCode
* Made file stubs for all of the queries that I want to practice
* Loaded my database with sample data
* I'm off to the races!

# doing the basics

* Finish up basic mongodb queries following [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/mongodb/index.php) and [mongo shell quick reference](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.4/reference/mongo-shell/)
* Pushed to my new [GitHub repo](https://github.com/lyliali/mongodb-playground) for this playground
* Sending thoughts and prayers to my future self.
