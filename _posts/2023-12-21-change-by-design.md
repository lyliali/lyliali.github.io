Below are my notes from reading _Change by Design_ by Tim Brown.

* A purely technocentric view of innovation is not sustainable
* We need an approach to innovation that can be integrated into all aspects of business and society
* Design skills: Match human needs with available technical resources within the practical constraints of business, integrating what is desirable to humans with what is technologically feasible and economically viable
* Design thinking relies on intuition, pattern recognition, and our ability to construct ideas that have emotional meaning as well as functionality, to express ourselves in media other than words and symbols
* Core of design process is integrating feeling, inspiration, and intuition with the rational and analytical
* Center of economic activity is shifting from manufacturing to knowledge creation and service delivery - innovation is no longer limited to creating physical products, but new kinds of processes, services, interactions, and ways of communicating and collaborating
* Innovation is a survival strategy
* Design thinking is holistic - not just a product, but also the retail experience and marketing
* Continuum of innovation: Inspiration, Ideation, Implementation
* Design thinking is fundamentally an exploratory process
* Emphasis on refining and rethinking assumptions instead of adhering strictly to a plan
* Designer (creative?) embraces constraints - Brown says this in contrast to artists/scientists in their pursuits of beauty and truth
* First stage of design process: Discovery of constraints, and establishing a framework for evaluating constraints
  - Feasibility (what is possible in the foreseeable future?)
  - Viability (what is part of a sustainable business model?)
  - Desirability
* Goal is to strike a balance
* Emphasis on human NEED, not DESIRE (which can be fleeting or manipulated)
* Purely technological innovation is limited - few technological innovations bring immediate economic reward that justify the time/resource investment they require; focusing on this is incremental progress, not innovation
* Designers excel at resolving constraints; design thinkers navigate between and among constraints in creative ways
* Designers think about problems; design thinkers think about projects
* Project is the vehicle that carries an idea from concept to reality - it is open-ended and ongoing
  - Balancing constraints on my [snakes and ladders project](https://lylia.li/snakes-app) - visual design changed midway through (from how to code a die in CSS --> automatic roll function)
* Brief: A set of mental constraints that serves as the starting mental framework
  - Benchmarks
  - Set of objectives
  - Constraints
  - May be refined over time
* I am a T shaped person (?) - engineering/computer science education, but also artist?
* Goal is to be on a team of talented, optimistic, and collaborative design thinkers
* Messy task: Generate ideas and build consensus around them
* Looking for a creative culture - that encourages experiments, taking risks, and exploration - ask for forgiveness, not permission
* Relationship between encouraging creativity within an organization and giving people space to be people, not forcing them to fragment their identities?
* Fully unlocked creativity through art - visual art, digital art, traditional pen and paper art, collage, ceramics, songwriting, musical performance
* How to figure out what people need? Insight, observation, and empathy
* I am not super interested in the chapter about human observation, either at the individual or collective level
* Convergent vs. divergent thinking
  - Convergent: Eliminate options and make choices
  - Divergent: Break barriers and multiply options
* Analysis vs synthesis
  - Analysis: Break a problem down into parts
  - Synthesis: Search for meanings and patterns in data
* Might be a good idea to try mimicking nature at the systemic level of organizations: Try something new and see what sticks
* Calls for bottom-up experimentation and guidance from above (tending, pruning, and harvesting ideas)
* Good leaders make sure everyone understands, appreciates, and has the ability to contribute to the overall vision
* To err is human, to forgive divine
* Use deadlines to turn options into decisions 
* Integrative thinking 
* Ability to hold multiple ideas in tension to reach new solutions - “both/and” instead of “either/or”
* Draws parallels between great managers and design thinkers because both embrace of complexity and draw inspiration from it rather than considering it a problem
* Prototyping services using scenarios/customer journeys: Keeps focus on user experience, not just the technical details
* Prototyping is a way to communicate and sell new ideas/concepts, also super useful for iteration and improvement
* Prototyping is inspirational, it inspires new ideas
* Prototypes should develop an idea “just enough”
* William Morris: believed industrialization severed art from utility (1800s)
* Lawrence Lessig: we moved from a preindustrial world where most of us were producers to an industrial world where we have mostly become consumers of mass produced media
  - ... what comes after the industrial world??
  - Lessig’s idea: “a postindustrial digital age where we will once again create our own experiences”
* p115- talks about how we used to play our own music at home from buying sheet music, but then started exclusively listening to music… powerful idea
* How to design experiences that create opportunities for active engagement and participation?
* Participatory auction? Kind of like a show and tell, artist represents their own work, allow Q&A with audience, and then bidding?
* It’s pointless to try and change consumer behavior. Instead, build on existing behaviors
