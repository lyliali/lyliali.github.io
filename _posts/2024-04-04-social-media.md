I stumbled upon an [An Illustrated Field Guide to Social Media](https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/an-illustrated-field-guide-to-social-media) by [Ethan Zuckerman](https://ethanzuckerman.com/) (Williams alum btw) and Chand Rajendra-Nicolucci through my explorations on [All Tech is Human](https://alltechishuman.org/) and [New_Public](https://newpublic.org/).

Below are my notes!

# Civic Logic

**Characteristics**
- Narrow purpose
- Limits on engagement
- Focus on smaller group of users, not meant to appeal to masses

**Examples**
- Parlio: Purpose is to connect young leaders
- iTaiwan: No replies, standalone posts, map of users who had similar voting behavior on posts
- Gell.com: Purpose is to highlight the strongest arguments on both sides of a divisive topic. You can only reply with your opinion on the topic, or highlight the (de)merits of someone else's argument.
- Reddit: Highlighted not because it has civic ideology, but because its governance model (subreddits have moderators) is civic.

**Bottlenecks**
- Participation is highly regulated and demanding. That seems to be by design though. 

# Local Logic

**Characteristics**
- Geographically determined user base
- Strict identity verification
- Not anonymous
- Results vary depending on governance model
- In general, goal is community building

**Examples**
- Nextdoor: Posts published instantaneously, reactive moderation. This governance model can lead to toxic behavior within communities (misinformation, racism, pettiness).
- Front Porch Forum: Proactive moderation, slower publishing model (posts published once per day). Generally results in more wholsome community, but limits engagement.
- Neighbors
- NABUR

# Decentralized Logic

**Characteristics**
- Like email, emphasize protocol and interoperability between different service providers
- Emphasize privacy and autonomy - because they are built on decentralized models (federated or peer-to-peer), your data isn't going to a centralized server owned by a corporation
- Provide experiences similar to hegemonic centralized platforms

**Examples**
- Mastodon
- Planetary.social

**Bottlenecks**
- Network effect (Most of your friends are already on FB/Twitter/IG, so why would you move to a different platform?)
- Revenue model
