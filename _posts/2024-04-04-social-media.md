I stumbled upon an [An Illustrated Field Guide to Social Media](https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/an-illustrated-field-guide-to-social-media) by [Ethan Zuckerman](https://ethanzuckerman.com/) (Williams alum btw) and Chand Rajendra-Nicolucci through my explorations on [All Tech is Human](https://alltechishuman.org/) and [New_Public](https://newpublic.org/).

Below are my notes!

# Civic Logic

**Characteristics**
- Narrow purpose
- Limits on engagement
- Focus on smaller group of users, not meant to appeal to masses

**Examples**
- Parlio: Purpose is to connect young leaders
- iTaiwan: No replies, standalone posts, map of users who had similar voting behavior on posts
- Gell.com: Purpose is to highlight the strongest arguments on both sides of a divisive topic. You can only reply with your opinion on the topic, or highlight the (de)merits of someone else's argument.
- Reddit: Highlighted not because it has civic ideology, but because its governance model (subreddits have moderators) is civic.

**Bottlenecks**
- Participation is highly regulated and demanding. That seems to be by design though. 

# Local Logic

**Characteristics**
- Geographically determined user base
- Strict identity verification
- Not anonymous
- Results vary depending on governance model
- In general, goal is community building

**Examples**
- Nextdoor: Posts published instantaneously, reactive moderation. This governance model can lead to toxic behavior within communities (misinformation, racism, pettiness).
- Front Porch Forum: Proactive moderation, slower publishing model (posts published once per day). Generally results in more wholsome community, but limits engagement.
- Neighbors
- NABUR

# Decentralized Logic

**Characteristics**
- Like email, emphasize protocol and interoperability between different service providers
- Emphasize privacy and autonomy - because they are built on decentralized models (federated or peer-to-peer), your data isn't going to a centralized server owned by a corporation
- Provide experiences similar to hegemonic centralized platforms

**Examples**
- Mastodon
- Planetary.social

**Bottlenecks**
- Network effect (Most of your friends are already on FB/Twitter/IG, so why would you move to a different platform?)
- Revenue model

# Gift Logic

**Characteristics**
- Strong culture and values (reciprocity, gifting, appreciation, noncommercialism)
- Motivated by enthusiasm and passion
- When built around an existing community with strong norms, can be pro-social

**Examples**
- Archive of Our Own: Fanfiction archive built around fandom community
- AO3 has a grow your own mentality, built by community members for community members, and has features designed to serve that community

**Bottlenecks**
- Expertise
- Drop-offs in participation (initiatives largely volunteer-led)
- Tragedy of the commons

# Chat Logic

**Characteristics**
- Provide private, real-time communication
- More like a living room than a town square
- Discourage interoperability (helps companies monetize and control UX)
- Rely on donations, subs, paid features, and/or add-ons
- Moderation is up to the users
- Cater to a diverse set of communities with different needs

**Examples**
- Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, Snapchat, iMessage, Telegram, Signal

# Alt-Tech Logic

**Characteristics**
- Copy functionality of mainstream social media platforms, but arise in response to conflicts around deplatforming and censorship
- Tend to serve extermist/alt-right communities
- Ideologically motivated

**Examples**
- Gab
- Parler

**Bottlenecks**
- Funded for ideological purposes
- Deplatforming radical actors from mainstream media platforms can leaad to further radicalization of communities on alt-tech platforms
- Alt-tech platforms are hard to research because they don't have public APIs

# Forum Logic

**Characteristics**
- Encourage organization around subcultures (niches, specific topics with strong boundaries)
- Easier to moderate because the topic is so specific
- Bring together people with different backgrounds and origins around a similar interest
- Can also host toxic and extreme subcultures. In general, when you give people freedom to organize, it leads to both good and bad.
- May help to fend off context collapse. Conversations/interactions can be more productive in a closed context than open to the general public.

**Examples**
- Reddit
- 4chan

# Q&A Logic

**Characteristics**
- Designed around clear social roles (Questioner and Answerer)
- Rely on community/volunteer governance

**Examples**
- Quora
- Stack Overflow
- Yahoo Answers

**Bottlenecks**
- Community governance: Questions can be low quality, answers can be condescending

# Framework for Analyzing Social Media Platforms

The paper used the following six qualities to compare, contrast, and organize social media platforms:

- Technology
- Business model
- Ownership
- Governance
- Affordances (what functionality does it afford users?)
- Stakeholders
