Below are my notes from reading _Master of None_ by Clifford Hudson.

* Leadership is all about influence (52)
* It’s based on setting clear objectives, delegating authority, trusting staff, and inspiring others
* It’s the capacity to have an effect on character, development, or behavior of someone or something
* Leading is an exercise in understanding, inclusion, and harmony. Leading cannot be about stealing the show or imprinting your authority on everything you touch. It emphasizes commonalities over differences, and camaraderie over antipathy (69)
* The true leader mirrors the leader of a great band and is always trying to figure out ways to bring together otherwise discordant voices.
* On the importance of flexibility: Where is our routine making us incapable of quick change? And how can we keep our “how” [we get things done] in a state of flexibility?
